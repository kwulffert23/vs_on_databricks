# MAGIC # 🧠 Create and Test Vector Search Index from Billing FAQ Data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook walks through the end-to-end process of preparing a **vector search index** based on a synthetic FAQ dataset related to telecom billing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We use Databricks Vector Search to enable high-accuracy semantic retrieval of FAQ entries, forming the foundation for downstream use cases such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based question answering.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 📌 Key Steps in This Notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Generate a Billing FAQ Dataset**  
# MAGIC    Create a synthetic dataset of frequently asked billing questions and answers, and save it as a Delta table in Unity Catalog.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Configure & Create Vector Search Index**  
# MAGIC    - Enable change data feed on the Delta table  
# MAGIC    - Create a delta sync index using a specified embedding model  
# MAGIC    - Wait for the index to become ready
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Test the Vector Search**  
# MAGIC    Run a similarity search using a sample query (`"Can I change my bill due date?"`) and return the top matching FAQ entries.

# MAGIC ## 🧰 Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Unity Catalog enabled and configured
# MAGIC - Databricks Vector Search endpoint (configured and shared)
# MAGIC - A valid embedding model endpoint (e.g., `databricks-gte-large-en`)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ---
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook sets the foundation for using semantic search over unstructured customer support data and can easily be integrated with RAG agents or evaluation pipelines.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Update Databricks SDK and Vector Search Library
# MAGIC %pip install -U --quiet databricks-sdk==0.28.0 databricks-vectorsearch 
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Setup Vector Search Index Configuration
# TODO: Change config to your catalog, schema, etc 
CATALOG = config['catalog']
SCHEMA = config['database']
VS_INDX = config['vector_search_index']

VECTOR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT_NAME = config['VECTOR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT_NAME']
embedding_model_endpoint_name = config['embedding_model_endpoint_name']
vs_index_fullname = f"{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.{VS_INDX}"

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create Billing FAQ Dataset and Save as Delta Table
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Pandas DataFrame from the CSV-like input
faq_data = [
    (1, "Q: How is my bill calculated? A: Your bill includes your monthly plan fee, additional charges for extra services, taxes, and any applicable discounts. A detailed breakdown is available in your MyTelco account."),
    (2, "Q: Why is my bill higher than usual? A: Your bill may be higher due to extra data usage, international calls, roaming charges, or a recent plan change. Check the usage details in the MyTelco app."),
    (3, "Q: What happens if I don’t pay my bill on time? A: Late payments may incur a penalty and could lead to service suspension. Reconnection fees may apply. Set up autopay to avoid these issues."),
    (4, "Q: How can I set up autopay for my bill? A: Enable autopay by logging into your MyTelco account, navigating to the billing section, and selecting 'Set Up Autopay'."),
    (5, "Q: How do I dispute a charge on my bill? A: If you believe there's an incorrect charge, contact customer support within 30 days of receiving your bill. Provide supporting details for review."),
    (6, "Q: Can I get a refund for overcharges? A: Refunds for overcharges may be available depending on the case. Contact customer support for a review, and any approved refunds will be credited to your next bill."),
    (7, "Q: Why was I charged a late payment fee? A: Late fees apply when payments are made after the due date. Check your bill for the due date and ensure timely payments to avoid these charges."),
    (8, "Q: How do I check my data usage? A: You can check your real-time data usage in the MyTelco app or by logging into your account online."),
    (9, "Q: Why do I see a roaming charge on my bill? A: Roaming charges apply when using your phone outside your network’s coverage. Check your plan settings or enable roaming notifications to avoid unexpected charges."),
    (10, "Q: Can I change my bill due date? A: Yes, you can request a bill due date change by contacting customer support or modifying it in your account settings.")
